title: When does people tweet the most?
---

This weekend I've been collecting some tweets from Spain and UK in order to analyze what are the time slots where they have more activity. This is important because when I'm comparing frequencies from ES-Spain and ES-Global I have to keep in mind that there are also tweets in ES-Global which are actually from Spain too (and probably I need to give them less *priority*).

The results are pretty obvious, but I thought that maybe someone find them interesting and wanna see them. They show how Twitter's activity decreases at midnight, and how it maintains stable during the day. In Spain, it is significant that top Twitter's activity is from 21:00 to 23:00, which differs from UK citizens, where the activity focus is produced along the evening, probably because cultural behavior (?).

I've used [Google Charts](https://developers.google.com/chart/?hl=en) for printing out the graphics.
