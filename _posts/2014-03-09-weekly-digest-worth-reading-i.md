title: "Weekly digest: worth reading (I)"

On this new section I will try to weekly summarize what have been my favorites readings during the last seven days. Hope you find them interesting too and, as usual, you have the comments for sharing also other articles that you have read and have given you a nice point about some topic or a better understanding about it.

Because this week I've been working with Rake and performance tests in Rails, I read articles which have given me an overview about both themes. In addition, I've continued studying about Ruby and some of its most interesting features.
