title: My roadmap @ Codemotion 2014
---

This weekend I've been @ **Codemotion** (Madrid). This was the first time that I was attending to a dev conference but it was a really pleasant experience. Few days before going there, I was checking the agenda and selecting those conferences that fit my interests. One of my goals here wasn't just go deeper in technologies that I already know but to have a first introduction to others that I **should** know (Ember.js, Graph Databases and interesting Cloud and Big Data technologies - *sorry for the buzz words here*).

The following is my roadmap @ Codemotion 2014. I was taking some notes about interesting concepts, tools, technologies or frameworks shared by the speakers during the conferences in order to make a research later.
