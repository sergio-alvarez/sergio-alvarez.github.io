Breaking news! This week have been an amazing week in the dev atmosphere. [David Heinemeier Hansson](http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/archive.html) started an [incredible debate](http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/2014/tdd-is-dead-long-live-testing.html) with Uncle Bob and other **all-star** folks about the [benefits of the TDD practice](http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/2014/test-induced-design-damage.html).

Some of the blog posts which have replies to the ideas posted by **@dhh** are:

#### Kent Beck

* [RIP TDD](https://www.facebook.com/notes/kent-beck/rip-tdd/750840194948847)

#### Uncle Bob

* [Monogamous TDD](http://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2014/04/25/MonogamousTDD.html) (actually, I've already put this article the last week)
* [When TDD doesn't work.](http://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2014/04/30/When-tdd-does-not-work.html)
* [Test Induced Design Damage?](http://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2014/05/01/Design-Damage.html)
* [Professionalism and TDD (Reprise)](http://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2014/05/02/ProfessionalismAndTDD.html)

#### Martin Fowler

I think is not a coincidence that Martin Fowler has recovered an article from 2005 for talking about self testing code, refactoring and TDD...

### Jim Weirich

This last week I've seeing amazing talks of [Jim Weirich](https://github.com/jimweirich) about Ruby, Rails and Software Engineering in general. I'm really sad for did not know about him before he passed away on 19th February. He was the creator of [Rake](http://rake.rubyforge.org/) and one of the most outstanding programmers of his generation. Great skills for communicating and teaching others.

*Rest in peace and thanks for everything, Jim.*
