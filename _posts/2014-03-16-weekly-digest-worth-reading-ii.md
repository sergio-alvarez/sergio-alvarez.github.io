title: "Weekly digest: worth reading (II)"
---

The last week I found a really nice set of articles about **Scala** written by the IBM developers' team which gives a full overview about the Scala key-concepts.

It starts from the scratch, explaining simple concepts about functional programming and how Scala is built over the Java's Object Oriented philosophy, for finishing explaining other deeper points about how Scala works itself.

This is not a light reading, but I find them as a really good start point for programming in Scala (specially if you have a solid background in Java)

* [The busy Java developer's guide to Scala](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-scala01228/index.html) *by Ted Neward et al.* Â» link to the first chapter.

As usual, feel free for sharing other recommended readings that you have read during the last seven days!
