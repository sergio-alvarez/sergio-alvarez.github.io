Here are the reads which I enjoyed the most during the last weeks (yep.. sorry for the delay, but it was **holiday's time**!).

Some of them are really powerful (as the *Code Hoarders* by Uncle Bob) and others are inspiring and a little dense.

* [Manhattan, our real-time, multi-tenant distributed database for Twitter scale](https://blog.twitter.com/2014/manhattan-our-real-time-multi-tenant-distributed-database-for-twitter-scale) *by Peter Schuller && the Core Storage Team @ Twitter*
* [Code Hoarders](http://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2014/04/03/Code-Hoarders.html) *by Uncle Bob*
* [Guard and Default Operators of JavaScript](http://seanmonstar.com/post/707078771/guard-and-default-operators) *by Sean McArthur*
